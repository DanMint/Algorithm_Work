# Insertion Sort

Insertion sort is one of the easiest and one of the most fundamental algorithms used. It goes as follows:

1. we start from the start of the array namely we start with the first element
2. we check with the next element
3. if its bigger then we countinue to step (1)
4. if its smaller we rememeber the current number in a temp object, put the bigger (previous) number to where we are currently at and replace the numbers. Then we replace the previous (where the larger number was) with the temp object (the smaller number)
5. Countinue to step 2

## Time complexity

Best time: O(N) Linear
Worst tiem: O(N^2) Quadratic
